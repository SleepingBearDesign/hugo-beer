The Feisty Latina begins life in the style of an Imperial Stout, but takes on a south of the border attitude with an infusion of Mexican cacao nibs, ancho peppers, guajillo peppers [providing a mild spice and subte dark fruit character], vanilla, and cinnamon. The result is sweet, complex and slightly spicy. In essence, this beer is just like our taproom manager Alana, the self-proclaimed original "Feisty Latina."
