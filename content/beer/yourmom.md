We also call this the 'Morning After Stout,' because it's a perfect way to ease the pain of the morning after a night of celebrating. By combining our 1762 Imperial Stout with maple sycup, vanilla, and cinnamon, we created a beer that is both bold and comforting, with a flavor that unmistakably reminds us of your mom's French Toast. Have we mentioned that we love your mom?
