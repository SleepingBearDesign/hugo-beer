description = "There are four partners (and Pizza Lovers) in whistle punk.; Logan & Tami Pitts of North Muskegon, and restauranteurs Jeremy and Jamie Paquin of Mia & Grace. Over the past few years, this idea has come to be more a labor of pizza love as they refined dough recipes, played with tomatoes and sauces, and then finally settled on the best way to cook a truly wonderful pizza. They've eaten a lot of great pizza all over the country doing their 'research.' They are the only wood fired pizza oven in Muskegon. Being in a city that was once a lumber town, they found it only fitting to cook with wood chopped here. They top their pizzas with fresh vegetables and meats sourced from local farmers and friends. The pizzas will change often as they will top them with vegetables, etc. that are in season."
